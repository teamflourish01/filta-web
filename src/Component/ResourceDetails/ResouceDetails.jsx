            In today's digital world, the classic paper business card is quickly
            becoming obsolete. While these small rectangular pieces of cardstock
            have served professionals well for decades, they're now being
            superseded by a more efficient, sustainable, and dynamic
            alternative: digital business cards. As professionals strive to
            streamline their networking efforts and preserve a competitive
            advantage, the transition to digital business cards is more than a
            trend; it is a strategic requirement that is redefining how we
            communicate in the corporate world.

          <p className="desc-title-bottom">The Impact of Technology on</p>
          <p className="res-detail-desc">
            Traditional business cards have long been used for professional
            introductions, but their limits are becoming increasingly obvious in
            today's interconnected world. Physical cards can become lost,
            damaged, or forgotten, and manually entering contact information
            into digital systems is time-consuming and error-prone. According to
            studies, almost 88% of distributed business cards are discarded
            within a week. Digital business cards answer these concerns while
            also providing several benefits that are consistent with modern
            professional needs and technological growth.

            1. Networking Efficiency: A Revolution for Experts
          </p>
          <p className="res-detail-desc p-5">
            Professional connections have been completely transformed by digital
            business cards. By just tapping a few buttons on a smartphone or
            scanning a QR code in a short amount of time, it is possible to
            instantaneously share and save contact information. The awkward
            fumbling for physical cards and the subsequent laborious task of
            manually entering contact information into your phone or CRM system
            are eliminated with this simplified method.

          <p className="res-detail-desc p-5">
            Consider this: at a networking event, while others are exchanging
            paper cards that will inevitably end up in a pile to be processed
            later, digital business card users can:

          <p className="res-detail-desc p-5">
            One of the most significant advantages of digital business cards is
            their constant availability. No more realizing you've left your
            cards at the office or run out during an important networking event.
            Your digital business card is always accessible through your
            smartphone, ready to be shared at a moment's notice.

            The financial and environmental benefits of switching to digital

            An average professional might order 500 business cards annually,
            costing between $200 to $500, depending on quality and design.
